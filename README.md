🌾 agri-backend
A Node.js + Express backend service that powers an agriculture-focused React Native mobile application. This backend helps farmers make data-driven decisions using satellite NDVI data and weather/crop analytics.

🚀 Project Overview
This backend system supports a multi-step workflow for helping farmers analyze and optimize their farming practices:

User Location Input

Users can enter coordinates manually or use GPS location.

Select Farming Area

Choose a landmark or draw/select the area of interest on a map.

NDVI Data Retrieval

The backend fetches NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data from GeoTIFF files based on user coordinates.

Data Processing & Response

The backend processes and returns:

Vegetation health charts (NDVI over time)

Comparative data (e.g., “last year vs this year”)

Smart suggestions (e.g., “consider cultivating X crop for better yield based on current vegetation health”)

Frontend Integration

Sends chart-ready data and recommendations to the React Native frontend for visualization and decision-making.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Backend: Node.js, Express.js

GeoTIFF Parsing: Geotiff.js, GDAL (optional)

NDVI Data Source: Bhoonidhi / ISRO datasets

Weather/Crop APIs: Farmonaut, MapMyCrop, IMD

Frontend (connected): React Native app (not included in this repo)

📦 Features
🔍 Location-based NDVI data retrieval

🗺️ Area/landmark selection support

📊 Graph and chart data output (NDVI trends)

📈 Yield suggestion engine based on vegetation analysis

🧠 Historical NDVI comparison (year-on-year)

📌 Sample API Flow
1. POST /api/location
Input: Coordinates or GPS location

Output: Area options, nearby landmarks

2. POST /api/ndvi
Input: Selected area or polygon

Output: NDVI values, vegetation trends

3. GET /api/suggestions
Input: Coordinates, time range

Output: Crop/yield suggestions based on NDVI

🧪 Future Enhancements
🌦️ Integrate real-time weather forecasts

🛰️ Live satellite imagery support

📉 AI/ML-based crop yield prediction

🧭 Offline data caching for remote field access

📋 Prerequisites
Node.js (v18+)

NDVI GeoTIFF files (ISRO/Bhoonidhi format)

Environment variables for API keys

🧑‍🌾 Use Case
“A farmer opens the app, enters his farm’s coordinates or uses GPS. He selects his field on a map. The backend fetches satellite-based NDVI data for the area and compares it with past years. It returns easy-to-understand graphs and suggestions like ‘vegetation has dropped by 15% from last July – consider crop rotation or irrigation boost.’”
